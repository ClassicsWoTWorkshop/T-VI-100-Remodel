Thank you for downloading! To install, drag the three .wotmod files from the "MAIN MOD" folder to <Your WoT Directory\mods\<Game Version>.

(Example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\mods\1.17.0.1)




====OPTIONAL (compatibility with Zorgane's Gun Sounds):====

In case you run Zorgane's Gun Sounds, I have included an add-on to change the firing/reload sounds of the top gun to the correct ones (100 mm D-10T). To install, drag the "mods" folder from within "OPTIONAL - 100 mm gun sound" to <Your WoT Directory and merge with existing folders.

(Example: C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\)
